# C++

# Overview

This software is designed to meet these basic requirements: Variables, Expressions, Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Classes, Data structure from STL (such as a vector, list, or map), and Read and Write to a file.

The purpose of this program is to learn and create a working C++ application. I wanted something fun to showcase my knowledge of C++ in a game.

# Future Work

- Create a user interface with the display of the hangman
- Create a way that the random word doesn't repeat until all the words are used. 
- Add a way for the user to see the length of the word. e.g. _ _ _ _ _
- I want to better handle the case if there are multiple of the same letters in a word. 
- I want to add levels for the game that increase in difficulty
